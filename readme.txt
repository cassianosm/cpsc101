This website was developed as a project for the Introduction to Web Programming Course - CPSC 1045 at Langara, Fall 2017. 

It was based on the lab website used in the Introduction do Computer Science Course CPSC 1050, also at Langara. 

The main goal was to create the JavaScript version of some of the existing labs exclusively as a learning exercise.

Reference: this website is based on the Applets Website at http://faculty.mc3.edu/pvetere/Applets/ from Montgomery County Community College, 
which is based on the book: Explorations in Computer Science, Second Edition, by R. Mark Meyer.
